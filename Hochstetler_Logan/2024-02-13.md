--Today we obtained our microscope slides. We prepared a single sample chamber. To do this we placed two strips of double sided tape on the long edges of the slides and taped two slides together. We created a 1 cm gap in between the tape to act as the sample chamber. 
--The next step was to epoxy seal the slides together to prevent disassembly. We applied the epoxy to the long edges, leaving the ends open for the liquid sample solution to enter at a later date.
