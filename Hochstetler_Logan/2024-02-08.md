Read the following provided article and took physical notes ![[Boskovic et al. - 2024 - Acoustic trapping in the undergraduate laboratory.pdf]]
Did further research and found a very informative video https://youtu.be/VjfqYoA7rwY?si=mvvc7pbvbYvc3hiL
This video shows how acoustic trapping works in air creating a levitation effect. Could be an idea for a secondary experiment if time permits, it also seems very simple to set up.
