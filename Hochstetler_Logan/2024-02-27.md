--Today we obtained a solution of polystyrene and water from Dr. Z.  The solution is 28% solid, using 3.22 um polystyrene beads in ethanol.
--The research paper calls for "Beads of at least 2â€“3 um" and a bead stock solution of 33% solid in deionized water (or 1:2 ratio) for an experiment not using a microscope. So the solution should work for our purposes, testing proof of concept, and then moving onto the microscope version. The only concern may be the use of ethanol instead of deionized water.
--We then applied oil to the top of the sample chamber and placed our transducer on the end. We set the frequency to 300 kHz, our suspected resonance frequency, and did not see anything. I tried combing through frequencies and still didn't see anything. Here are my suspected issues:
	1. The transducer resonance frequency is too low
	2. I combed the frequencies too fast and missed the optimal frequency
	3. Our sample chamber is no good
	4. The solution is suboptimal
	5. The function generator is creating too high of a voltage, Vpp should be ~12V, and I can only decrease it to ~24V
