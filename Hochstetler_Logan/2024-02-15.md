--Today I stripped the wires on the transducer. Then I connected it to the function generator, and connected the oscilloscope in parallel to measure voltage and frequency.
--I attempted to find the resonance frequency of the transducer. The ideal frequency for our experiment is 0.8-1.5 mHz. To find the resonance frequency I was going based off of this picture: ![[Pasted image 20240215104104.png]]
and the description: ![[Pasted image 20240215104208.png]]
--After only playing with it for 5 or so minutes and using my best judgement, to me the frequency that best matched this image and description was at 0.3 mHz or 300 kHz
