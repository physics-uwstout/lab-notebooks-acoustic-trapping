--Today we created a sample solution using 2 mL of powdered milk and 198 mL of deionized water. We used glycerol as a coupling agent for the transducer onto the microscope slides
--We attempted to view our first example of acoustic trapping but were unable to do so or really even understand what we were seeing in the microscope. Here are my hypotheses why it didn't work:
- The milk particles are not ideal for acoustic trapping (diameter or mass)
- We need to add more parts milk to water to see them in the microscope (50:1 or 20:1 maybe?)
- The bottom light of the microscope is inhibiting viewing, we need a different light source
- The resonance frequency of the transducer ~300 MHz is not high enough to produce acoustic trapping of particles of this size. This is my strongest guess why it didn't work
- The connectors of the transducer needed to be repaired via solder, and this is somehow effecting our results
